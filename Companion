# This program uses both CamelCase (PascalCase) and snake_case. After 40+
# years of writting code in more languages then I remember, it really
# doesn't matter after a while. Even beginner programmers should get used
# to seeing multiple formats intermixed.

# Yes, I know Python is meant to be object oriented... When I started write the
# program, I never really expected it to grow beyound a fasination, let alone to where
# it is now. I litterally started with 2 functions (as seen in the Extra directory).
# As each itdea came, problems requiring solutions started to take the shape of
# functions. The program just grew and grew. At some point, I'll rewrite this... but
# for now, it works well and is quite fast.

# ***** IMPORTANT:
#   This program uses ADMINISTRATOR priviledges.

# Forum and thread support is a strange approach. Threads are treated like
# channels, with a few extra bits. Webhooks, slowdown mode, edits, even the way
# message are sent into the thread is effected. Activitieshave to be tested and
# is it is a thread, most of the time, you have to pull the parent channel.
# Webhooks and slowdown mode, in particular, do NOT have separate
# functionalities of a channel, even though discord treats them like a channel.

### *** At some point, I'm going to really have to rewrite this. The forum/thread
###     detection code is a stinking hot mess and scattered everywhere.

# Areas where a classifier can improve functionality (at a higher cost):
#   Phone number detection would have a significantly lower lecel of false
#   positives.
#
#   Technical messages versus non-technical for varying the temperature of
#   the conversation.

# Emotion scoring (classifier)
#
#   Emotional scoring (major scale): 10 (love) to -10 (hatred) sets the
#   overall tone of the AI towards the user. This can be translated the
#   scale of a warm and inviting conversation to a cold and distant one.
#   The system role could easily be adapted to act on this information.

#   (Minor scale) Assuming 0 is neurtal and the starting point of all
#   interactions, a monor scale could be used to evaluate each input from 1
#   (warm) to -1 (cold) to give that input a score. The scale needs to
#   adjust though to ensure the major scale doesn't climb too quickly in
#   either direction. For example, if the emotional score (major scale) is
#   1, then the minor scale range needs to be 0.9 to -1.

#   The minor scale is added or subtracted to/from the mahor scale to get the
#   final emotion score of the bot at the last interaction. This will carry
#   between channel towards the same user.  The bot will greet the same user
#   accross all channel with the same emotion resonance.

# Listed in order of when the service was added.

# added openai
# added ollama
# added together.ai     Free models available.
# added cohere          Trial key 1000 free requests per month
# added huggingface     free key is 1000 requests per day, fragmented responses, 1
#                       respons coud=8 requests or more
# added anthropic       token counting is a hot mess, but functional,
#                       no free credits, pay upfront
# added perplexity.ai   No free credits, pay upfront, search oriented, not
#                       good for conversational, but searching is outstanding.

# added openrouter.ai   Several free models limited to 200 requests per day,
#                       has just about every major provider, even some of the
#                       more difficult ones to build for. Paid models will have
#                       a premium for the normalization service. No direct model
#                       support like you would get directly from model vender
#                       (OpenAI, Anthropic, so on). Uses all OpenAI code. Token
#                       counting is a nighmare but the basic len/4 works
#                       reasonly well. toktoken() does NOT work.

# --> Not in a specific order, add support for the following engines (Maybe):

#   DeepInfra           https://deepinfra.com/pricing
#   fireworks.ai
#   Anyscale
#   Replicate
#   google.ai (genini)  This is a hot mess to try to develop for. There
#                       are a serious cascading issues from message
#                       format to usage consideration... The API is
#                       free, but the developement process is hideous.
#   Vertex AI           Now GoogleAI
#   AI21labs            Seriously broken in multiple ways. API does not work.
#                       Disappointing becuse this really looked put
#                       together with as much expertise as Open AI, even
#                       directly addressing token counting upfront.

### Special functions/Decorators
###

# The `function_timer` decorator measures and prints the execution time of
# both synchronous and asynchronous functions. For synchronous functions,
# it records the start and end times, calculates the elapsed duration, and
# outputs the time taken. For asynchronous functions, it uses the same
# approach but accommodates `await` for proper timing. This decorator helps
# in profiling and performance monitoring by providing precise timing
# information for each wrapped function.

### Functions for AbuseIPDB
###

# This set of functions works together to identify potentially harmful or

# known scam list. If the link isn’t on either list, it looks up its background
# using a service called AbuseIPDB, which evaluates whether the link’s
# associated IP address has been reported for malicious activity. If the link
# is flagged as dangerous, it’s marked as unsafe. This helps ensure that
# harmful links can be quickly identified and dealt with.

### Emotional Score functions
###

# The `CalculateMinorScale` function translates an emotional score,
# referred to as the "MajorScale," into a refined range of minor emotional
# variations, represented by `MinorMax` and `MinorMin`. The MajorScale,
# constrained between -10 and 10, determines the sensitivity of these
# minor emotional shifts. Positive scores reduce the upper range of
# variability, while negative scores lessen the lower range, and a neutral
# score provides a balanced range. This ensures that emotional intensity
# is scaled proportionally, with the output reflecting subtle fluctuations
# formatted to two decimal places for precision.

# The `CalculateEmotionalScore` function evaluates and updates the
# emotional score (`escore`) of a conversation, using an external
# classifier to assess the sentiment of the provided text. Starting with a

# scoring range based on the `CalculateMinorScale` function, which
# determines acceptable emotional variability. If the bot includes an
# emotional classifier, the function calculates an additional sentiment
# score (`mscore`) using the AI classifier and adjusts the `escore`
# accordingly. The updated score is written back to the file, and any
# placeholders in the response buffer (`buff`) are replaced with the new
# score, ensuring dynamic emotional feedback.

# This group of functions is designed to retrieve AI-generated responses
# from various platforms using APIs. Each function interfaces with a
# different AI service, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face,
# TogetherAI, Cohere, Ollama, and Perplexity. The functions send input
# messages, along with parameters such as temperature and frequency
# penalty, to the respective service and receive a response. The responses
# are then processed and returned as text, often with additional details
# logged for transparency. These functions allow for flexibility in using
# multiple AI models, enabling seamless integration with different AI
# providers based on the user's preference or specific use case.

# The `on_message_edit` event handles edited messages in Discord, checking
# for potential moderation issues such as leetspeak attempts, vulgarity, and
# malicious edits aimed at extracting personal information like age. Upon
# detecting an edit, it first verifies that the content has indeed changed
# before proceeding. It then checks if the message is in a thread and
# adjusts accordingly. If the message involves a bot persona, it logs the
# changes and proceeds with moderation. The function scans the edited
# message for specific "leet" words that might indicate an attempt to bypass
# filters or ask for personal details like age. Additionally, it checks for
# vulgar language, comparing the message content with a predictive model. If
# vulgarity is found and the bot is set to block it, the message is deleted,
# and the user is notified. If leetspeak is detected, the bot notifies
# moderators with details of the edit, and an embedded message is created
# for transparency. One of the more insidious attacks the bot counters
# involves an attacker initially asking an innocent question, like "how many
# sides to an octagon?" The victim may respond "8," and then the attacker
# edits the message to read, "How old are you?" or "What is your age?" The
# attacker takes a screenshot of the edited message, which could be used to
# falsely accuse the victim of violating Discord's age restrictions, risking
# a permanent ban. This malicious tactic exploits the fact that Discord's
# age policy is strictly enforced. A major vulnerability in this system
# exists when a message is posted before the bot is loaded and then edited
# afterward; the bot will not receive the edit notification, creating a
# loophole that only Discord can fix. To combat this, the bot aims to delete
# the original message, preventing such malicious actions. If the message

# The `on_typing` event is triggered when a user begins typing in a text
# channel. This method is used to manage user activity by adjusting slow
# mode settings based on typing behavior. It first checks if the typing
# event is occurring in a direct message or thread and ensures it operates
# only in regular channels. The code tracks user activity by assigning a
# multiplier (`joins`) to factor in the number of recent member joins in
# the guild. This helps adjust the expected number of typing users in a
# channel based on the server size.

#The primary function of this event is to detect potential raid-like
#activity by analyzing the number of typing users in a channel. If the
#typing count exceeds a certain threshold (based on the server's size and
#channel distribution), slow mode is applied to prevent spam. The slow mode
#duration is dynamically adjusted based on the number of typing users and
#the expected user count for that channel. If the number of typing users is
#significantly higher than expected, the bot logs a potential raid attempt
#and sets a more aggressive slow mode duration.

#Additionally, the event includes a cooldown mechanism that prevents
#multiple slow mode adjustments in a short period, ensuring that changes
#are made only once every 5 minutes per channel.

# At the heart of the bot is its core function, which revolves around
# processing and responding to messages within a Discord server. When a
# message is received, the bot first examines who sent it and confirms that
# it wasn’t sent by itself, ensuring it only interacts with users. Once
# this is established, the bot determines which persona it should adopt
# based on the server settings. This allows the bot to be flexible and
# respond in different ways depending on the environment it’s in. For
# example, it might be more formal in some servers and more casual in
# others.

# After identifying the appropriate persona, the bot processes the content
# of the message. It looks for key words or phrases to understand the
# intent of the message. If the message is a command or question, the bot
# will trigger the corresponding response or action. This could range from
# providing an answer to a query to executing a special function like
# checking the status of the server or deleting harmful content. The bot’s
# responses are always carefully crafted to be contextually appropriate,
# ensuring that it communicates in a way that matches the tone and setting
# of the conversation.

# The function also includes checks for harmful content, like spam or
# malicious links. If a message contains something that could disrupt the
# conversation or harm the server, the bot can take immediate action, such
# as deleting the message or issuing a warning. This ensures that the
# environment stays safe and free from unwanted disruptions. Additionally,
# the bot is programmed to detect when users are engaging in private
# messages and will politely remind them that it only interacts within the
# server, maintaining clear boundaries for its interactions.

# Ultimately, this core function allows the bot to continuously monitor and
# interact with the flow of conversation in the server. It ensures that the
# bot remains responsive and adaptive, delivering personalized messages
# while keeping the space safe and organized. By focusing on this core
# task, the bot can maintain a smooth and engaging experience for users,
# adjusting its behavior as needed to meet the specific needs of each
# server.
